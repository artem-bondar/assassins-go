# Assassins Go board game

A turn-based puzzle game in Unity created under Wilmer Lin's [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/make-an-assassins-go-board-game-in-unity/).

The project is unfinished and frozen until better times, a very low chances to be ever continued or
finished in an upcoming nearby future.

The last finished chapter is next: *05 Game Management - 028 InitBoard*
